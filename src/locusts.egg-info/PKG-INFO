Description: # Locusts
        
        Locusts is a Python package for distributing many small jobs on a system (which can be your machine or a remote HPC running SLURM).
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Locusts package is currently part of the ![PyPI](https://test.pypi.org) Test archive.
        In order to install it, type
        
        `python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps locusts`
        
        Note: PyPI Test is not a permanent archive. Expect this installation procedure to change over time.
        
        
        ## How it works
        
        Locusts is thought for whom has to run a huge amount of small, independent jobs and has problems with the most used schedulers which will scatter the jobs over many nodes, or queue them indefinitely.
        Moreover, this package provides a safe, clean environment for each instance of the job, and keeps and collects notable inputs and outputs.
        In short, locusts creates a minimal filesystem where it prepares one environment for each job it has to execute. The runs are directed by a manager bash script, which schedules them and reports its stauts and the one of the jobs to the main locusts routine, which will always be run locally. Finally, it checks for a set of compulsory output files and compiles a list of success and failures.
        
        ### Modes
        
        Locusts can help you distributing your jobs when you are facing one of these three situations:
        * You want to run everything in local on your machine (**local mode**)
        * You want to submit jobs to a HPC (**remote mode**)
        * You want to submit jobs to a HPC, which shares a directory with your local machine (**remote-shared mode**)
        
        ### Environments
        
        Once you give locusts the set of input to consider and the command to execute, it creates the Generic Environment, a minimal filesystem composed of three folders:
        * An execution folder, where the main manager scripts will be placed and executed and where execution cache files will keep them updated on the progress of the single jobs
        * A work folder, where the specific inputs of each job are considered and where outputs are addressed
        * A shared folder, where common inputs have to be placed in case a group of different jobs wants to use them
        
        Starting from this common base, there are two different environments that can be used:
        * The default Locusts Environment consists in having one folder corresponding to each set of files for running one instance of the command
        * The Custom Environment lets the user employ any other filesystem
